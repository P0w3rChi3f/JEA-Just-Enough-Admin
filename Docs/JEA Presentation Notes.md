# PowerShell JEA  

PowerShell JEA allows us Systems Administrators to empower our fellow admins, developers, and security personal to accomplish what they need to on our systems. Give them just enough administrative permissions to accomplish their duties without interrupting your day or night. This talk shows how to assign roles and give the appropriate permissions to those roles.
